# UCDMCMC
 UCD MCMC model fitting code

## INSTALLATION NOTES

### Install UCDMCMC

ucdmcmc can be installed from git:

	```
	git clone
	cd ucdmcmc
	python -m setup.py install
	```

A check that this worked is that you can import ucdmcmc into python/jupyter noteobook, and that the ucdmcmc.MODEL_FOLDER points to the models folder that was downloaded

### Install SPLAT

For the interim, you will also need to install SPLAT to work with the spectral data files - this is not automatically installed on setup. The instructions are essentially the same:

	```
	git clone https://github.com/aburgasser/splat.git
	cd splat
	python -m pip install .
	```
